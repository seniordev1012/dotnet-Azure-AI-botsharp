# Get Started

### Get started with Pizza Bot

In order to allow developers to experience the convenience of BotSharp as quickly as possible, we have designed a basic sample project PizzaBot. This example allows you to run it quickly on your local machine. This example requires `llama-2` quantized model downloaded with `gguf` format if you want to run locally.

```console
git clone https://github.com/SciSharp/BotSharp
```

Double click `PizzaBot` to start the solution.
