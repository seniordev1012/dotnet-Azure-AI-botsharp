# Get Started

### Get started with Pizza Bot

In order to allow developers to experience the convenience of BotSharp as quickly as possible, we have designed a basic sample project PizzaBot. This example allows you to run it quickly on your local machine. This example requires `llama-2` quantized model downloaded with `gguf` format if you want to run locally.

### Run in command line

```console
git clone https://github.com/SciSharp/BotSharp
cd BotSharp
dotnet run --project .\src\WebStarter\WebStarter.csproj -p SolutionName=PizzaBot
```

Here you go, you will see this running screen.
