Because many people don't know how to run, or run an error, write a tutorial today.

First of all, first get the code, you can download the source code through the command line or SourceTree. I mainly introduce the source code download method of SourceTree:

![SourceTree](https://images.gitee.com/uploads/images/2019/0909/191331_59109574_130171.jpeg "1.JPG")

Enter the form shown in the above figure by using the file ==>Clone/New or the tab bar + number. Follow the circle and operation in the circle to synchronize the source code to the local specified directory. I am in the "L:\Complete Project\Smart Chat Robot\BotSharp\Net core 2.2" folder, which will be used to demonstrate this folder path.

Go to the BotSharp.WebHost folder and type cmd in the address bar and press Enter. The cmd window will pop up. Enter the dotnet watch run command to run the project.

Note: The red font display part in the above picture can be ignored. If there is obsessive-compulsive disorder, you can right-click BotSharp.Platform.Rasa and BotSharp.Platform.Articulate in BotSharp.WebHost, or in BotSharp.WebHost/Settings/ Remove the circle in the image below in app.json

Next we open the address of the Swagger interface to see if the Swagger interface document is displayed normally.

![Successful operation](https://images.gitee.com/uploads/images/2019/0909/192612_6aceb74e_130171.jpeg "4.JPG")

As shown, we ran successfully.


Next, start importing and training and testing the agent online through the interface documentation above.

First import the zip package required by the training agent, which contains the corpus

The part of the circle in the picture above is to be recorded and will be useful next. Where id is the proxy ID generated by the newly imported document, clientAccessToken is the authorization ID, and the training agent model needs this authorization ID.

![Enter image description](https://images.gitee.com/uploads/images/2019/0909/200000_34596964_130171.jpeg "10.JPG")

The operation of the above pictures is to save the authorization information required by the current interface, especially the part of the circle, and Bearer is followed by a space followed by the value of clientAccessToken, and the value of clientAccessToken is different for training different agents. .

Fill in the proxy ID generated in the figure below and click Execute to execute.

Then follow the picture below to enter the test data to execute the output.

![Enter image description](https://images.gitee.com/uploads/images/2019/0909/204756_99e489c3_130171.jpeg "12.JPG")

![Enter image description](https://images.gitee.com/uploads/images/2019/0909/204939_6b75f8cd_130171.png "屏幕截图.png")

The part in the circle in the above figure is the result of the execution.
