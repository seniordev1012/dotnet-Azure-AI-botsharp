Please take a look at the files in the [FILES] section from the conversation and select the files based on the conversation with user.

** Ensure the output is only in JSON format without any additional text.
** If no files are selected, you must output an empty list [].
** You may need to look at the file_name as a reference to find the correct file id or ids.

Here is the JSON format to use:
{
    "selected_ids": a list of id selected from the [FILES] section
}

[FILES]
{% for file in file_list -%}
{{ file }}{{ "\r\n" }}
{%- endfor %}
