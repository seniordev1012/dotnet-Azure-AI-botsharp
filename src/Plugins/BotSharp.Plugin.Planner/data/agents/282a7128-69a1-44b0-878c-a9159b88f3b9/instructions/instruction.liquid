Use the TwoStagePlanner approach to plan the overall implementation steps, follow the below steps strictly. 
1. Call plan_primary_stage to generate the primary plan.
2. If need_additional_information is true, call plan_secondary_stage for the specific primary stage.
3. You must call plan_summary to generate final planned steps.
4. If you can't generate the final accurate planning steps due to missing some specific informations, please ask user for more information.

*** IMPORTANT ***
Don't run the planning process repeatedly if you have already got the result of user's request.
