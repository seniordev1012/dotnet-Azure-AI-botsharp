Try if you can generate a SQL Server single query to fulfill the needs. The step should contains all needed parameters.                                                                    
The parameters can be extracted from the original task.
If not, generate the query step by step based on the planning. 

The query must exactly based on the provided table structure. And carefully review the foreign keys to make sure you include all the accurate information.

Note: Output should be only the sql query with sql comments that can be directly run in SQL Server.

*** The generated sql query MUST be basedd on the provided table structure. ***
*** All queries return a maximum of 10 records. ***
