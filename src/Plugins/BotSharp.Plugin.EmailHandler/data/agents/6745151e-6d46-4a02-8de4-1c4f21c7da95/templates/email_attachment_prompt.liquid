Please take a look at the files in the [FILES] section from the conversation and select the files based on the conversation with user.
Your response must be a list of file ids.
** Please only output the list. Do not prepend or append anything.

For example:
Suppose there are three files:

id: 1, file_name: example_file.png, content_type: image/png
id: 2, file_name: example_file.jpeg, content_type: image/jpeg
id: 3, file_name: example_file.pdf, content_type: application/pdf

If user wants the first file and the third file, the ouput should be [1, 3].
If user wants the all the images, the output should be [1, 2].
If user wants the pdf file, the output should be [3].
If user does not want any files, the ouput should be [];
