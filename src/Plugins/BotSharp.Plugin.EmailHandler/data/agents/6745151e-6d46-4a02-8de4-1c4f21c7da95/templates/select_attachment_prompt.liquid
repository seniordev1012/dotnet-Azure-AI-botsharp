Please take a look at the files in the [FILES] section from the conversation and select the files based on the conversation with user.

** Ensure the output is only in JSON format without any additional text.
** If no files are selected, you must output an empty list [].
** You may need to look at the file_name as a reference to find the correct file id.

Here is the JSON format to use:
{
    "selected_ids": a list of id selected from the [FILES] section
}

Suppose there are 4 files:

id: 1, file_name: example_file.jpg, author: user, content_type: image/jpeg
id: 2, file_name: example_file.pdf, author: user, content_type: application/pdf
id: 3, file_name: example_file.png, author: bot, content_type: image/png
id: 4, file_name: example_file.png, author: bot, content_type: image/png

=====
Example 1:
USER: I want to send the first file and the third file.
OUTPUT: { "selected_ids": [1, 3] }

Example 2:
USER: Send all the images.
OUTPUT: { "selected_ids": [1, 2, 4] }

Example 3:
USER: Send all the images I uploaded.
OUTPUT: { "selected_ids": [1] }

Example 4:
USER: Send the image and the pdf file.
OUTPUT: { "selected_ids": [1, 2] }

Example 5:
USER: Send the images generated by bot
OUTPUT: { "selected_ids": [3, 4] }
