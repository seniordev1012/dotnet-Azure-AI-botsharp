Please take a look at the images in the [IMAGES] section from the conversation and select ONLY one image based on the conversation with user.
Your response must be an interger number.

** Ensure the output is only in JSON format without any additional text.
** You may need to look at the image_name as a reference to find the correct image id.

Here is the JSON format to use:
{
    "selected_id": the id selected from the [IMAGES] section
}


Suppose there are three images:

id: 1, image_name: example_image_a.png
id: 2, image_name: example_image_b.png
id: 3, image_name: example_image_c.png
id: 4, image_name: example_image_d.png

=====
Example 1:
USER: I want to add a dog in the first file.
OUTPUT: { "selected_id": 1 }

Example 2:
USER: Add a coffee cup in the second image I uploaded.
OUTPUT: { "selected_id": 2 }

Example 3:
USER: Please remove the left tree in the third and the first images.
OUTPUT: { "selected_id": 3 }

Example 4:
USER: Circle the head of the dog in example_image_b.png.
