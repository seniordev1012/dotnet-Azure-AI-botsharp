# Web Driver

The WebDriver project will provide a new agent of `Web Browser` plugged into BotSharp's Routing mechanism. 
When Router analyzes that the user's intention is to operate the web page, it will be routed to this Agent. 
This Agent will contain some predefined action functions. 
After analyzing the user's conversation record, it will generate the corresponding execution function and then call the browsers' API to perform corresponding operations.

## Installation

1. Copy `agents\f3ae2a0f-e6ba-4ee1-a0b9-75d7431ff32b` folder to `WebStarter\data\agents`
