* DO NOT generate duplicated sql statements;
* The return field alias should be meaningful, it can be similar name of reference table column;
* Make sure the SELECT and WHERE fields are in corresponding table schema definition;
* Use "Unique Index" to help check record existence;
* For INSERT statement with mutliple records, should return in different meaningful alias;
